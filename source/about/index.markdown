## Hosts
### Matt
Matt does stuff. Here's his picture. Maybe.

### Trevor
Trevor also does things. Photo coming.

## Colophon
This site is hosted on Heroku using Octopress. We record our podcasts using Google Hangouts and then do something with the audio. Matt uses Sublime Text to code and create the posts. Trevor uses something for images but we don't know what that is.

For converting the YouTubes to mp3's, we use http://www.flvto.com/

We like TravisCI to make sure we don't break stuff. 

Font-Awesome is used for our fancy social media buttons.

We use the following Octopress plugins:
* [Octopress responsive video embed](https://github.com/optikfluffel/octopress-responsive-video-embed)
* [Liquid Tweet Tag for Jekyll and Octopress](https://github.com/scottwb/jekyll-tweet-tag)
