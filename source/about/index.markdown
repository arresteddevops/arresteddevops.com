### Trevor
Trevor also does things. Photo coming.

## Colophon
This site is hosted on Heroku using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/). We record our podcasts using [Google Hangouts on Air](http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/onair.html) and then do something with the audio. Matt uses [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) to code and create the posts. Trevor uses something for images but we don't know what that is.

For converting the YouTubes to mp3's, we use [FLVTO](http://www.flvto.com/)

We like [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) to make sure we don't break stuff. 

[Font-Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) is used for our fancy social media buttons.

We use the following Octopress plugins:

+ [Octopress responsive video embed](https://github.com/optikfluffel/octopress-responsive-video-embed)
+ [Liquid Tweet Tag for Jekyll and Octopress](https://github.com/scottwb/jekyll-tweet-tag)
+ [stickers-octopress](https://github.com/polinom/stickers-octopress)
+ [MP3 tag for Jekyll](https://gist.github.com/tabletick/3654288) (which relies on [audio.js](http://kolber.github.io/audiojs/))
+ [octopress-semantic](https://github.com/hoatle/octopress-semantic)
