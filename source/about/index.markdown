## Hosts
### Matt
Matt Stratton is a cloud infrastructure consultant with 10th Magnitude, which means he lays out in a field, looks up in the sky, and says "that one looks like a dinosaur...that one is a race car"...

When he's not doing that, he's helping clients improve their agility and velocity by adapting DevOps principles and practices including Continuous Delivery, Infrastructure as Code, and a bunch of other fancy stuff. He lives in Chicago and has an unhealthy obsession with Doctor Who, Firefly, and Game of Thrones. And whiskey.

Matt also hates writing about himself in the third person.

### Trevor
Trevor also does things. Photo coming.

## Colophon
This site is hosted on Heroku using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/). We record our podcasts using [Google Hangouts on Air](http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/onair.html) and then do something with the audio. Matt uses [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) to code and create the posts. Trevor uses something for images but we don't know what that is.

For converting the YouTubes to mp3's, we use [FLVTO](http://www.flvto.com/)

We like [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) to make sure we don't break stuff. 

[Font-Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) is used for our fancy social media buttons.

We use the following Octopress plugins:

+ [Octopress responsive video embed](https://github.com/optikfluffel/octopress-responsive-video-embed)
+ [Liquid Tweet Tag for Jekyll and Octopress](https://github.com/scottwb/jekyll-tweet-tag)
+ [stickers-octopress](https://github.com/polinom/stickers-octopress)
+ [MP3 tag for Jekyll](https://gist.github.com/tabletick/3654288) (which relies on [audio.js](http://kolber.github.io/audiojs/))
+ [octopress-semantic](https://github.com/hoatle/octopress-semantic)
