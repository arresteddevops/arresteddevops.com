The world definitely needs another DevOps podcast. We're still working out what exactly we'll be covering. Right now, the main reason this site is up is that [Matt](https://twitter.com/mattstratton) is trying to play around with [Octopress](http://www.octopress.org) and get some stuff working all fancy-like.

But how did this happen? I'm a big fan of a few great DevOps type podcasts, most notably the following:

* [The Ship Show](http://www.theshipshow.com)
* [Food Fight](http://foodfightshow.org/)
* [DevOps Cafe](http://devopscafe.org/)

With so much great content out there, why do we need another one? One thing that came to mind is that, for better or for worse, these podcasts have a very heavy FOSS focus to them. Which is fine, because FOSS is pretty cool. But there's a lot of Windows out there in the real world as well. It seemed that there were more voices to be heard. Which basically maeans that I want you to hear **my** voice. 

I've had this domain for a bit, and always intended to create a blog here. However, a podcast seemed like a cool idea. Especially since I've never done one before. But I wasn't about to do one myself. Because, well, I'm kind of lazy. Also, I'm the "Ops" in "DevOps", and that makes for a one-sided conversation. 

I met [Trevor](https://twitter.com/trevorghess) at the [Downtown Chicago Azure Meet-Up](http://www.meetup.com/Downtown-Chicago-Azure-Meet-Up/) back in October, and he presented about Continuous Integration at the next month's meetup. Of course, I completely steamrolled everything he had to say, which is why I immediately thought of him as someone to do a podcast with. 

We don't know what this will be yet. Watch this space for updates. I don't expect that your professional life will change or your organization will achieve amazing levels of productivity just based on anything we say, but hopefully you'll enjoy it once we have something. 

One thing I can guarantee: Lots of Doctor Who references.
