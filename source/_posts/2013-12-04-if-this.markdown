First thing I learned? When using the rake task of "new_post" in Octopress, don't include a comma. It loses it.

I'm writing this post to make sure our [if this then that](https://ifttt.com) recipe is working. It also seemed like a fun time to try out the [Liquid Tweet Tag for Jekyll and Octopress](https://github.com/scottwb/jekyll-tweet-tag) that I just put into the code.
