As of the time of this post, the subhead of Arrested DevOps is "DevOps Podcast for fun but no profit". Which is there mostly as a placeholder, as so much of the AD stuff is right now. But that's not really a good subhead. Or a tagline. Or a way to summarize what Arrested DevOps is about.

We'll be (hopefully) recording our first podcast on Thursday. Which is two days from now. We need a tagline by then, just to help people understand what we are about. And as much as I love the name and the riff on Arrested Development, I don't want to use that in the tagline.

Fundamentally, our goal is to be accessible, friendly to people new to the concepts, and very devoid of "inside baseball". And also to not make people feel dirty for using Microsoft products. Any ideas for a great tagline? Please either tweet use at [@arresteddevops](https://www.twitter.com/arresteddevops) or leave your thoughts in the comments.
