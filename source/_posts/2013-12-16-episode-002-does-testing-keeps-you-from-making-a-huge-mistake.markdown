Summary/Show Notes
-----------------
Things get off to a great start during the retro, where Trevor complains about destroying his USB 3.0 drivers due to a Win 8.1 upgrade and Matt turns into a Cylon. 

[Test Kitchen](http://kitchen.ci) is now officially 1.0, but does't really support Windows, but that doesn't stop Matt from wanting to hack it to make it work anyway.

"Testing is any action taken to give you information about the actual state of your software, vs your assumptions" - Lanette

"A lot of developers look at testing like insurance - it's not going to prevent a disaster, but it's going to help you mitigate those problems" - John

Spirited discussion about the value of code coverage as a metric, and our panelists mostly violenly agree that it is not a valuable number in a vacuum.

We also discuss that it is possible to approach all of life like a QA tester.
