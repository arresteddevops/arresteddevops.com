The big news of the day is that OpsCode, [after raising $32MM in Series D, has changed their name to Chef](http://pulse2.com/2013/12/09/opscode-chef-32-million-98296/). Because, well, that's what they are. The Chef people.

That's cool and all, but the twitters quickly panicked at how challenging it would be to find ANYTHING Chef-related on the Googles.

Let it be said. The new name for "Chef" is "Cherf". And I helped.
