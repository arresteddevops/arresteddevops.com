Matt and Trevor talk about the reason for Arrested DevOps, the format of the show (sort of), and then "what does DevOps mean?" Then somehow the topic devolves into open floorspaces and Matt puts his foot in his mouth a few times.

[DevOps - the Title Match](http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2013/06/04/devops-the-title-match/) - John Vincent' blog post about what DevOps is and isn't, that Matt totally read from and referred to.

[Food Fight Show](http://foodfightshow.org/) - The Podcast where DevOps chefs do battle. These guys totally watched this live. Which is more than I can say for [The Ship Show](http://theshipshow.com/). Just kidding.
