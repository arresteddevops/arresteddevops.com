    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The world definitely needs another DevOps podcast. We&rsquo;re still working out what exactly we&rsquo;ll be covering. Right now, the main reason this site is up is that <a href="https://twitter.com/mattstratton">Matt</a> is trying to play around with <a href="http://www.octopress.org">Octopress</a> and get some stuff working all fancy-like.</p>

<p>But how did this happen? I&rsquo;m a big fan of a few great DevOps type podcasts, most notably the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.theshipshow.com">The Ship Show</a></li>
<li><a href="http://foodfightshow.org/">Food Fight</a></li>
<li><a href="http://devopscafe.org/">DevOps Cafe</a></li>
</ul>


<p>With so much great content out there, why do we need another one? One thing that came to mind is that, for better or for worse, these podcasts have a very heavy FOSS focus to them. Which is fine, because FOSS is pretty cool. But there&rsquo;s a lot of Windows out there in the real world as well. It seemed that there were more voices to be heard. Which basically maeans that I want you to hear <strong>my</strong> voice.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had this domain for a bit, and always intended to create a blog here. However, a podcast seemed like a cool idea. Especially since I&rsquo;ve never done one before. But I wasn&rsquo;t about to do one myself. Because, well, I&rsquo;m kind of lazy. Also, I&rsquo;m the &ldquo;Ops&rdquo; in &ldquo;DevOps&rdquo;, and that makes for a one-sided conversation.</p>

<p>I met <a href="https://twitter.com/trevorghess">Trevor</a> at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Downtown-Chicago-Azure-Meet-Up/">Downtown Chicago Azure Meet-Up</a> back in October, and he presented about Continuous Integration at the next month&rsquo;s meetup. Of course, I completely steamrolled everything he had to say, which is why I immediately thought of him as someone to do a podcast with.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t know what this will be yet. Watch this space for updates. I don&rsquo;t expect that your professional life will change or your organization will achieve amazing levels of productivity just based on anything we say, but hopefully you&rsquo;ll enjoy it once we have something.</p>

<p>One thing I can guarantee: Lots of Doctor Who references.</p>
