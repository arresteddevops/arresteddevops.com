<h2>Panel<a name="panel"></a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Matt Stratton <a href="http://github.com/mattstratton">github</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mattstratton">twitter</a>, irc: MattStratton, <a href="http://www.mattstratton.com/">blog</a></li>
<li>Trevor Hess <a href="https://github.com/trevorghess">github</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/trevorghess">twitter</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Outline<a name="outline"></a></h2>

<p>Matt and Trevor talk about the reason for Arrested DevOps, the format of the show (sort of), and then &ldquo;what does DevOps mean?&rdquo; Then somehow the topic devolves into open floorspaces and Matt puts his foot in his mouth a few times.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lusis.org/blog/2013/06/04/devops-the-title-match/">DevOps &ndash; the Title Match</a> &ndash; John Vincent&#8217; blog post about what DevOps is and isn&rsquo;t, that Matt totally read from and referred to.</p>

<p><a href="http://foodfightshow.org/">Food Fight Show</a> &ndash; The Podcast where DevOps chefs do battle. These guys totally watched this live. Which is more than I can say for <a href="http://theshipshow.com/">The Ship Show</a>. Just kidding.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First thing I learned? When using the rake task of &ldquo;new_post&rdquo; in Octopress, don&rsquo;t include a comma. It loses it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing this post to make sure our <a href="https://ifttt.com">if this then that</a> recipe is working. It also seemed like a fun time to try out the <a href="https://github.com/scottwb/jekyll-tweet-tag">Liquid Tweet Tag for Jekyll and Octopress</a> that I just put into the code.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As of the time of this post, the subhead of Arrested DevOps is &ldquo;DevOps Podcast for fun but no profit&rdquo;. Which is there mostly as a placeholder, as so much of the AD stuff is right now. But that&rsquo;s not really a good subhead. Or a tagline. Or a way to summarize what Arrested DevOps is about.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll be (hopefully) recording our first podcast on Thursday. Which is two days from now. We need a tagline by then, just to help people understand what we are about. And as much as I love the name and the riff on Arrested Development, I don&rsquo;t want to use that in the tagline.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, our goal is to be accessible, friendly to people new to the concepts, and very devoid of &ldquo;inside baseball&rdquo;. And also to not make people feel dirty for using Microsoft products. Any ideas for a great tagline? Please either tweet use at <a href="https://www.twitter.com/arresteddevops">@arresteddevops</a> or leave your thoughts in the comments.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The world definitely needs another DevOps podcast. We&rsquo;re still working out what exactly we&rsquo;ll be covering. Right now, the main reason this site is up is that <a href="https://twitter.com/mattstratton">Matt</a> is trying to play around with <a href="http://www.octopress.org">Octopress</a> and get some stuff working all fancy-like.</p>

<p>But how did this happen? I&rsquo;m a big fan of a few great DevOps type podcasts, most notably the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.theshipshow.com">The Ship Show</a></li>
<li><a href="http://foodfightshow.org/">Food Fight</a></li>
<li><a href="http://devopscafe.org/">DevOps Cafe</a></li>
</ul>


<p>With so much great content out there, why do we need another one? One thing that came to mind is that, for better or for worse, these podcasts have a very heavy FOSS focus to them. Which is fine, because FOSS is pretty cool. But there&rsquo;s a lot of Windows out there in the real world as well. It seemed that there were more voices to be heard. Which basically maeans that I want you to hear <strong>my</strong> voice.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had this domain for a bit, and always intended to create a blog here. However, a podcast seemed like a cool idea. Especially since I&rsquo;ve never done one before. But I wasn&rsquo;t about to do one myself. Because, well, I&rsquo;m kind of lazy. Also, I&rsquo;m the &ldquo;Ops&rdquo; in &ldquo;DevOps&rdquo;, and that makes for a one-sided conversation.</p>

<p>I met <a href="https://twitter.com/trevorghess">Trevor</a> at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Downtown-Chicago-Azure-Meet-Up/">Downtown Chicago Azure Meet-Up</a> back in October, and he presented about Continuous Integration at the next month&rsquo;s meetup. Of course, I completely steamrolled everything he had to say, which is why I immediately thought of him as someone to do a podcast with.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t know what this will be yet. Watch this space for updates. I don&rsquo;t expect that your professional life will change or your organization will achieve amazing levels of productivity just based on anything we say, but hopefully you&rsquo;ll enjoy it once we have something.</p>

<p>One thing I can guarantee: Lots of Doctor Who references.</p>
